## What is lytopix

Lytopix is a small and simple game engine / emulator that can help you design and run your 2D games. 

## Main ideas of lytopix

1) The game engine shoud be one executable file - and everything else in the folder is your game files. 
2) Lytopix should have a simple, easy to understand scripting language (for non technical people) - but most importantly a good documentation with examples for every feature.
